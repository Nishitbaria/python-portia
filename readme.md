# AI Marketing Agent: UGC Ads Creator

## Problem Statement

The digital advertising industry faces a critical challenge: creating high-quality UGC (User Generated Content) ads is prohibitively expensive and time-consuming. Traditional agencies charge $500-2000 per video and take weeks to deliver, while existing AI tools like [Creatify.ai](https://creatify.ai/about) lack the intelligent workflow orchestration and human-in-the-loop capabilities that marketing teams need.

For founders running multiple SaaS products or e-commerce stores, maintaining consistent social media presence is an additional challenge. They struggle to create engaging content regularly, manage posting schedules across multiple platforms, and maintain brand consistency while focusing on core business operations.

**Current Pain Points:**

- **Time**: Manual UGC creation takes 1-3 weeks per video
- **Cost**: Agency fees range from $500-2000 per single ad
- **Complexity**: Multiple tools required for different workflow stages
- **Quality**: Limited human oversight in AI-generated content
- **Scalability**: No unified system for content planning and distribution
- **Content Management**: Founders and e-commerce owners struggle to maintain consistent social media presence
- **Posting Frequency**: Manual posting is time-consuming and often inconsistent
- **Multi-Platform**: Managing content across different social media platforms requires multiple tools and workflows

## Our Solution

We built an intelligent AI marketing agent using Portia AI that automates the entire UGC creation workflow while maintaining human creativity and oversight. Our agent transforms weeks of work into minutes, reducing costs by 95% while improving content quality.
