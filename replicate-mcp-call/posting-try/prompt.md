Change the flow such that it

- Its gives Choice to ask "You wanna bring your own character" or "use prebuild characters"
- If choosed then bring your own characters then ask a url
- if choosed prebuild then its gives options from choices of links ( from array of url)
- then after this, ask for product image link
- after it makes, a llm call which takes prompt and returns product description ( system prompt will added by me)
- Then I will again ask for 2 choices, "Enter your own dialog" or Auto Dialog
- Then If AutoDialog is choose then make a llm call and then generate a dialog based on the prompt
- Then make call to replicate model
