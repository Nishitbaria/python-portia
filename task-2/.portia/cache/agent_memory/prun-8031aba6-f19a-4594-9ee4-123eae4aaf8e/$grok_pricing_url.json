An LLM (Large Language Model) is an AI system trained on vast amounts of textual data using deep learning and transformer architectures to understand and generate human-like language. The LLM API Pricing Calculator is a tool designed to help users estimate the cost of using various Large Language Model APIs, embeddings and Fine-tuning based on their specific usage needs. The pricing estimates are based on the latest publicly available pricing information from the API providers. The calculator will provide a combined comparison of the estimated costs.\", \"score\": 0.7316155, \"raw_content\": null}, {\"url\": \"https://tech.co/news/grok-ai-pricing\", \"title\": \"Grok AI Pricing: How Much Does Grok Cost in 2025? - Tech.co\", \"content\": \"Grok, the brainchild of Elon Musk’s xAI, is a bit of an oddball in the generative AI world thanks to its irreverent personality and real-time access to X’s social media data. * The full version of Grok AI is accessible through X Premium subscriptions, with plans starting at $8 per month.
