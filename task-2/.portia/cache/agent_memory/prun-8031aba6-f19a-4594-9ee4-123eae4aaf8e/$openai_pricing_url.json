An LLM (Large Language Model) is an AI system trained on vast amounts of textual data using deep learning and transformer architectures to understand and generate human-like language. The LLM API Pricing Calculator is a tool designed to help users estimate the cost of using various Large Language Model APIs, embeddings and Fine-tuning based on their specific usage needs. The pricing estimates are based on the latest publicly available pricing information from the API providers. The calculator will provide a combined comparison of the estimated costs.\", \"score\": 0.709684, \"raw_content\": null}, {\"url\": \"https://docsbot.ai/tools/gpt-openai-api-pricing-calculator\", \"title\": \"Free OpenAI & every-LLM API Pricing Calculator | Updated Aug 2025\", \"content\": \"| OpenAI | GPT-4o Mini Audio (Text) gpt-4o-mini-audio-preview | 128K | $0.15 | $0.6 | $0.0004 | $0.45 | | OpenAI | GPT-4o Mini Realtime (Text) gpt-4o-mini-realtime-preview | 128K | $0.6 | $2.4 | $0.0018 | $1.80 | | OpenAI | GPT-4o Realtime (Text) gpt-4o-realtime-preview | 128K/16K | $5 | $20 | $0.0150 | $15.00 | | OpenAI | GPT-4o Audio (Text) gpt-4o-audio-preview | 128K/16K | $2.5 | $10 | $0.0075 | $7.50 | For instance, if a model has a context length of 8,000 (8K) tokens, it can consider up to 8,000 tokens from the input and output in a single pass.
